This is a small script to quickly set up a geth private testnet with a set of
default accounts, it will create a database under `/tmp/geth_private_testnet` by
default.

Note that there are private keys in the keystore directory, the passphrase for
all 5 is the string `blah`, *THESE ARE PROVIDED ONLY FOR TESTING PURPOSES WITH
THIS SCRIPT*
